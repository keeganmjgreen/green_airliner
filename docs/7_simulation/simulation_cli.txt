usage: Simulation of UAVs Mid-Air Refueling an Airliner of Arbitrary Fuel
       [-h] [--config-dir CONFIG_DIR]
       [--simulation-viz-enabled SIMULATION_VIZ_ENABLED]
       [--view {side-view,tail-view,map-view}]
       [--track-airplane-id TRACK_AIRPLANE_ID] [--record {viewport,graphs}]

The simulation includes the takeoff, climb, descent, and landing of each of
the aircraft as well as the interaction between the airliner and each UAV
throughout the flight.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config-dir CONFIG_DIR
                        Path containing `simulation_config.yml` file.
  --simulation-viz-enabled SIMULATION_VIZ_ENABLED
                        Whether to visualize the airliner and UAVs in-browser
                        while the simulation runs. Defaults to true. If set to
                        true, requires a `viz_config` to be specified in the
                        `simulation_config.yml` file. If set to true, the
                        browser tab opens in your system's default browser.
                        With the assumption that this is Google Chrome, the
                        program firstly and automatically opens a new "guest"
                        Chrome window in which this new browser tab will be
                        opened.
  --view {side-view,tail-view,map-view}
                        What to show in the viewport in which the 3D
                        visualization is rendered when `--simulation-viz-
                        enabled=true`. side-view: View the airplane from the
                        side. Requires specifying a `--track-airplane-id`.
                        tail-view: View the airplane from its tail (third
                        person). Requires specifying a `--track-airplane-id`.
                        map-view: View the airports, airplanes and their paths
                        from above, magnified, in a "bird's eye" view. Cannot
                        be used while specifying a `--track-airplane-id`
  --track-airplane-id TRACK_AIRPLANE_ID
                        The ID of the airplane to track (e.g., "Airliner")
                        when `--viz-enabled=true` and `--view` is not "map-
                        view".
  --record {viewport,graphs}
                        What part of the in-browser visualization to screen-
                        record, if any, when `--viz-enabled=true`.
