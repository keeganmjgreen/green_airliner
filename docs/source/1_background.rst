Aviation releases massive amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributes to approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions. It makes the most sense to attempt to create solutions to the largest portions of CO₂ and other GHG emissions first, and as such solutions are being developed (albeit not quickly enough) to decarbonize the world's electrical grids, manufacturing, and transportation, the latter including electric cars and similar electric vehicles. However, despite many of these sectors being challenging to electrify or reduce their emissions by other means, doing so for travel by air remains elusive due to its inherent inefficiency and need of enormous amounts of energy. To reach net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, the 2.5% global contribution of air travel must eliminated and the industry decarbonized. Furthermore, the depletion of oil reserves toward the end of the century will require that this be done soon, or alternatives be found, regardless.

It should be noted that while aviation contributes to 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, it contributes in total to 3.5% of the world's *effective radiative forcing*, which is a more complete metric for aviation's affect on the warming of the earth. In other words, aviation causes a disproportionately large share of warming relative to its share of CO₂ emissions. This is because only one third of the effective radiative forcing is caused by CO₂, most of the remainder being caused by contrails of water vapor which is a stronger GHG despite its significantly shorter half-life in the atmosphere. This is not an excuse to continue jet-fueled air travel and will also be accounted for when considering alternative fuels.
