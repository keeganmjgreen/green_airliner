Study Objectives
================

The goal for which this study is done is the reduction of air travel GHG emissions using electric commercial airliners.

The intention of this study is to be as realistic as possible, particularly in the technologies used, which should be practical enough and available to use in the present day. If a product or piece of equipment is not already available, it should be reasonable to fabricate it using present-day manufacturing methods and materials. This study does not aim to propose a far-fetched yet well-marketed concept; on the contrary, it discusses potential ideas using mostly existing if not already widespread technology.

A notable limitation of this study is that it does not include or discuss the power plant (engine) of the electric commercial airliner.
