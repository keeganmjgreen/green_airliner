Administrative and Logistical Considerations
============================================

Just as the modern flight and commercial airliner industry demands intense administration, testing, and orchestration, so would the mid-air recharging of electric airliners. Collaboration and standardization of these activities at the international level will help maximize the program's safety and make research, development, testing, and worldwide adoption much faster.

However, there are limits to this which should not be ignored and, as with the space race, there should be some degree of individuality or "competition" between nations or organizations to foster the development of unique, innovative ideas and increase the likelihood that one implementation will succeed.

The mid-air recharging of electric airliners would require more orchestration than ever between airliners and airports among nations, from a technical standpoint as well as a political one.

Administration
--------------

.. TODO

Testing
-------

For utmost safety, all tests/trials would be done without passengers and with airliner pilot(s) trained and equipped in case of emergency.

Among many types of testing would be two types of air trial, which are summarized as follows.

The **type 1 air trial** is a minimal test of a UAV's docking sequence with an airliner in which the airliner is not flying its full route and, thus, recharging is not necessary. The air trial can also test multiple UAVs docking with the airliner in succession. The type 1 air trial would not be performed over intermediate airports' airspace, such that mid-air collisions or crashes over/in populated areas are avoided.

The **type 2 air trial** mimics the full recharging process of an airliner by one or more UAVs operating out of an intermediate airport, thereby testing their flight plan and docking sequence with the airliner (charging the airliner if necessary). Type 2 air trials would only be attempted if and when the type 1 air trials succeed. For coordination and to simplify the first tests, the type 2 air trials may follow the following progression:

1. Operating the test airliner out of the same airport as the UAV(s).
2. Operating the test airliner out of one or two nearby airports.
3. Operating the test airliner along its full route from origin to destination airport.

This progression of tests gradually increases the number of airports involved, the degree of coordination thusly required between them, the time taken to perform each test from start to finish, and the degree to which actually charging the airliner in mid-air is necessary for it to be able to complete its route.

Rollout
-------

Rollout refers to the gradual application of (a) UAV-to-airliner docking, and (b) the mid-air recharging of electric airliners by this means, to airliners with passengers. Except perhaps in the case of electric airliners fulfilling relatively short routes, the rollout of both (a) and (b) is required for the rollout of electric airliners themselves.

Similar to item (2) in the progression of type 2 air trials, the rollout of (a) and (b) may first be applied to airliners fulfilling relatively short routes, flying over or being redirected to fly over an intermediate airport out of which a UAV operates. The airliner does not need to be in need of recharging, nor does it need to be an electric airliner (qualifying as rollout of (a) but not (b)).

Logistics
---------

The air travel / commercial airliner industry requires extensive infrastructure (airports and communications) and services including air traffic control and refueling services, not to mention the supply chain of jet fuel.

In the advent of electric airliners, some of these services/infrastructure will be minimized (fueling of airliners), some will be expanded (airport infrastructure and communications), and some will be introduced (recharging of airliners on the ground). It is very likely that electric airliners will require much more time to "refuel" on the ground, potentially demanding more airliners and more space at airports for the greater number of airliners that are on the ground and recharging at any given time. Electric airliners may also require longer runways. Furthermore, increased communications---between UAVs and air traffic control, and between UAVs and electric airliners---will be necessary for monitoring and coordinating the UAVs.

Orchestration
-------------

The air travel / commercial airliner industry requires the intelligent coordination of assets around the world---airliners, fuel, airport gates, taxiways, runways, and airspace. Airliners need to have the correct amount of fuel before departure, and need to be at the correct airport gate, taxiway, or runway at the correct time. Refueling services need to be at the correct gate and airliner at the correct time. Runways, taxiways, and airspace must be managed to prevent collisions.

Not only will much of the refueling be replaced with the recharging of electric airliners (subject to the same constraints as above), but UAVs will be added, forming a fleet of aircraft being operated out of each airport in need of similar management to existing ones.
