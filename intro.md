# The Problem
# Simulation of Mid-Air Refueling of a Hydrogen-Powered Commercial Airliner

## The Problem
- Commercial airliners contribute approximately 2.5\% of global CO2 emissions, which is incompatible with the current goal of attaining net-zero by 2050 to help mitigate the imminent climate crisis.
- Airliners and passengers refuse to reduce air travel and will continue to do so unless a similarly affordable alternative is created.
- Unless batteries or green fuel technology improves dramatically (which is unlikely), the traditional implementation of commercial aviation at the current size and serving similar routes will be infeasible.

## Proposed Solution
- Use of green alternatives to jet fuel is limited by their relatively low energy density â€“ storing the same amount of energy requires carrying far more weight, requiring more fuel, and so on.
- Midair refueling of commercial airliners by jet-fueled UAVs (which would travel much shorter distances) may be a solution.
- Extra green fuel would be delivered to an airliner by UAVs operating out of airports over which the airliner flies.
- Each UAV would take off, dock with the airliner to partially refuel it, then land again for its own refueling.
