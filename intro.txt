The Problem
    Commercial airliners contribute massive amounts of CO2 emissions, which is incompatible with the current goal of attaining net zero by 2050 to help mitigate the climate crisis.
    Airliners and passengers are refusing to reduce air travel and will continue to do so until oil reserves are depleted (in which case the damage is done), unless a similarly affordable alternative is created.
    Unless batteries or green fuel technology improves dramatically (which is unlikely), electric commercial airliners of similar size and serving similar routes will be infeasible.
Proposed Solution
    Use of green alternatives to jet fuel is limited by their comparatively low energy density; storing the same amount of energy requires carrying far more weight, requiring more fuel, and so on.
    Mid-air refueling of commercial airliners by jet-fueled UAVs (which would travel shorter distances) may be a solution.
    The extra weight in green fuel would be efficiently carried and delivered to the airliner by UAVs operating out of airports over which the airliner flies.
    Each UAV would take off, dock with the airliner to partially refuel it, then land again for its own refueling.
