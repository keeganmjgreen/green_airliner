- The airliner completed its 4000-km, hydrogen-powered flight from JFK to LAX in 7 hours.
- The airliner consumed a total of ... hydrogen, ... of which was delivered mid-flight by the ... UAVs.
- The UAVs themselves consumed ... avgas.
- The net CO2 emitted was ..., or ... (...) less than if the flight were jet-fueled.

## What should I think of this?
- There are two ways to interpret this solution:
- (1) Such a drastic and unorthodox solution is required to help decarbonize air travel – making it a reasonable solution.
- (2) Such a solution is unreasonable and will never be accepted – it serves only as a demonstration that air travel cannot be decarbonized and that it must instead be severely reduced.
- Both interpretations are valuable.
