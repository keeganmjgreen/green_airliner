# Simulation of Mid-Air Refueling of a Hydrogen-Powered Commercial Airliner

## The Problem
- Commercial airliners contribute approximately 2.5\% of global CO2 emissions, which is incompatible with the current goal of attaining net-zero by 2050 to help mitigate the imminent climate crisis. Meanwhile, airlines and passengers refuse to reduce air travel. \textbf{How might we deal with this?}
- Biofuels and electrofuels are currently expensive and still pollute (more than just CO2). Batteries and even hydrogen fuel have poor energy densities relative to jet fuel. \textbf{How might we work around this and use hydrogen anyway for continental air travel?}

## Proposed Solution
- Use of hydrogen is limited by its relatively low energy density â€“ storing the same amount of energy requires carrying far more weight, requiring more fuel, and so on.
- Midair refueling of commercial airliners by jet-fueled UAVs (which would travel much shorter distances) may be a solution.
- Extra hydrogen would be delivered to an airliner by UAVs operating out of airports over which the airliner flies.
- Each UAV would take off, dock with the airliner to partially refuel it, then land again for its own refueling.
